# Facts

1. Understand invariants: Statements that should always hold true. 
2. Write invariant functions. 

# Implementation of a Decentralized Stablecoin. 



# About 
This is a foundry project that was done as the as a `pinnacle project` for the [Patrick Collins 27hrs Foundry Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23#lesson-12-foundry-defi--stablecoin-the-pinnacle-project-get-here).




# What does the project do?
1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged -> $1. 
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
    - Can only be minted with enough collateral (coded). 
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Wrapped Crypto)
    - wBTC
    - wETH
4. Both Stateless (fuzz) and Stateful (Invariant) tests in foundry.  
  

# Misc
- Contains scripts to deploy the contract and some initial tests written in Foundry. 

## WIP
- More tests
